# Aspiny-Spiny-Neuron-Classification

Morphological characteristics like the presence (spiny) or absence (aspiny) of dendritic spines may relate to specific physiological features such as action potential decay, firing rate, or resting membrane potential. For example, in rat hippocampi, aspiny neurons have higher evoked action potential firing rates due to varying rise and decay times compared to spiny neurons. (Livsey & Vicini, 1992). We used data from the Allen SDK(software development kit) database to determine if the presence or absence of neuron spines correlated with evoked action potential firing rates in both mouse and human populations across many brain regions. The interpreted object-oriented language Python was used to extract data, feature engineer, and clean it. After exploratory data analysis, machine learning algorithms such as multivariate logistic regression and decision trees were implemented to predict neuron status. After thorough analysis, we concluded that aspiny neurons would have a higher average firing rate than spiny neurons.
